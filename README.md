# Twitter-integration
Code excertps for CleanApp + Twitter integration.

(2022) Focus on core reporting integration functionality.

(2023) Improved reporting, analytics, mapping functionality.

(2023-2025) Potential ways to extend and modify code to add new features and functionality:

- Adding support for multiple hashtags that can trigger the sendDumpsiteTweet(lat: Double, long: Double, photos: List[String]) function. This would allow users to include different hashtags in their tweets to send Dumpsite data to different Circles or to send different types of Dumpsite data.
- Adding support for users to view their Dumpsite data tweets in the app. This could include a timeline or map view of the user's tweets, allowing them to see the location and photos of the Dumpsites that they have reported.
- Adding support for users to share their Dumpsite data tweets with others who also sendDumpsiteTweet. 
- Adding support for users to earn rewards for their Dumpsite data tweets. This could include in-app rewards or real-world rewards, such as discounts or coupons from businesses that support clean-up efforts, or rewards from organizations that are working to reduce waste and litter.
- GroupTweet: add support for users to collaborate on Dumpsite data tweets. This could include a group messaging feature that allows users to discuss the Dumpsites that they have reported and share ideas for cleaning up the Dumpsites or preventing future hotspots.
- Longterm/Longform Scaling: add support for users to report other types of environmental issues, such as pollution, water contamination, or wildlife habitat destruction. This could include additional hashtags that trigger different types of data collection and reporting, or could include a feature that allows users to report issues with freeform text and photos.
